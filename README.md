# Cucumber-Value

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hatofmonkeys/cucumber-value.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hatofmonkeys/cucumber-value)

Cucumber-value aims to bring Value-Driven Development to Cucumber.

See the [blog post](http://blog.hatofmonkeys.com/blog/2011/11/06/automating-value/) for details on the idea.

This is little more than a demo of the idea at the moment, I hope to make it useful in the near future.

## Demo from features

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake

Requires Ruby >= 1.9.2 to pass the specs.

## Usage

Add the gem to your project's Gemfile. Use it like the demo additions application in the supplied features. Wonder why it's not very useful at this stage. Fork the git repository, make it better, issue a pull request. Relax.

## Contributing

Please, please, please fork this, improve it, and issue a pull request. You know you want to.
